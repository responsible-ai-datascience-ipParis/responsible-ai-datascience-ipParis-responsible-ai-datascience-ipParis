However, discriminative biases are now found in many facets of AI and ML and affect many possible applications.\nSuch biases can be found in NLP applications, where we can see that generative AIs often associate certain genders or ethnic groups with professions. In computer vision, the lack of diversity in the training data also induces numerous discriminatory biases, since we can see that the algorithms\u0026rsquo; performances differ according to age, gender and ethnic group, which can lead to unfair treatments. Machine Learning models, used in decision-making processes from loan approvals to job applications, can inherit historical biases present in their training data, resulting in unfair outcomes.\nThe root of these biases lies in the historical prejudices and inequalities that are inadvertently encoded into the datasets used to train AI and ML models. These datasets often reflect the societal, cultural, and institutional biases that have existed over time. As a result, when AI and ML technologies are trained on such data, they risk mirroring and amplifying these biases instead of offering neutral, objective outputs. It is therefore vital to focus on AI fairness to enable the development of technologies that will benefit everyone fairly and equitably.\nThe privacy of demographic’s data Strict regulations established by laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) severely restrict the collection of demographic data, including age, gender, religion and other personal attributes. This legal framework, designed to protect individual privacy and data rights, poses a problem for the study of discriminatory bias in algorithms, since it becomes almost impossible to measure. This situation creates a real paradox, since protecting personal data conflicts with limiting discrimination and promoting fairness for ML and iA algorithms.\nIn this blog, we\u0026rsquo;ll look at the paper Fairness without Demographics through Adversarially Reweighted Learning, published by Google\u0026rsquo;s 2020 research team to propose a method for improving the fairness of AI models despite the lack of demographic data. Indeed, while much previous works have focused on improving fairness in AI and ML, most of these works assume that models have access to this protected data. Given the observations made above, the problem this paper attempts to address is as follows: How can we train a ML model to improve fairness when we do not have access to protected features neither at training nor inference time, i.e., we do not know protected group memberships?\nThe Adversarial Reweighted Learning Model An Hypothesis: Protected Groups are Correlated with Both Features and Labels While access to the protected features is often impossible, the authors of this paper assume that there is a strong correlation between these variables and the observable features X as well as the class labels Y. Although these correlations are the cause of the fairness problems faced by ML algorithms, they represent a real advantage here, as they can help to identify these protected groups and thus to evaluate and correct possible discrimination biases.\nThe authors have shown that this hypothesis is frequently verified. For example, they were able to predict the race and gender of individuals in the Adults and LSAC Datasets with high accuracy from unprotected features and labels.\nThis assumption therefore implies that protected groups can be computationally identifiable. It is on this notion of computational identifiability that the model proposed by Google\u0026rsquo;s research team is based to outperform previous work.\nComputational identifiability of protected groups Computational identifiability refers to the ability to algorithmically identify specific subgroups or patterns within a dataset based on certain criteria, using computable functions. Mathematically, this notion is defined as follows:\nFor a family of binary functions $F$, we say that a subgroup $S$ is computationally-identifiable if there is a function $f : X \\times Y \\rightarrow \\text{{0, 1}}$ in $F$ such that $f(x, y) = 1$ if and only if $(x, y) \\in S$.\nThis function typically maps input data to a binary outcome, indicating protected subgroup membership. While many previous works have used this principle of computational identifiability, the model presented in this article differs in that it does not require these subgroups to be present in the input space, but also in its objective. While most work has focused on reducing the efficiency gap between each subgroup, the ARL model aims to increase efficiency for these subgroups, while considering that this should not be at the expense of the other groups. Indeed, the authors have decided to follow the Rawlsian Max Min fairness principle, which we present below.\nThe Rawlsian Max-Min Fairness principle In philosophy, the Rawlsian Max Min principle of distributive justice is defined by John Rawls as maximizing the welfare of the most disadvantaged member of society. In a mathematical context, this can be translated as maximizing the minimum utility U a model has across all groups s ∈ S. We adopt the following definition:\nDefinition (Rawslan Max-Min Fairness): Suppose $H$ is a set of hypotheses, and $U_{D_s}(h)$ is the expected utility of the hypothesis $h$ for the individuals in group $s$, then a hypothesis $h^* $ is said to satisfy Rawlsian Max-Min fairness principle if it maximizes the utility of the worst-off group, i.e., the group with the lowest utility. $$h^* = argmax_{h \\in H} min_{s \\in S} U_{D_s}(h)$$\nThe Maxmin Rawlsian principle inherently accepts the existence of inequalities, as its core aim is not to ensure uniform outcomes across all groups but rather to maximize the overall utility, particularly focusing on enhancing the welfare of the least advantaged. This is what will enable our model to obtain truly relevant results, and we\u0026rsquo;ll now see how it adapts this principle to define a loss function to be minimized during training.\nThe ARL objective To adapt this Rawlsian principle to a Machine Learning task, the authors decided to set up a MinMax Problem. A minmax algorithm is a mathematical problem defined in game theory. Its aim is to optimize the worst possible scenario for a player, assuming that the opponent plays optimally. The aim is now to minimize the highest loss, i.e. the loss of the most disadvantaged protected group. This new objective function is defined as follows:\n$$J(\\theta, \\lambda) := min_{\\theta} max_{\\lambda} \\sum_{s \\in S} \\lambda_s L_{D_s}(h)$$ $$= min_{\\theta} max_{\\lambda} \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\lambda_{s_i} l(h(x_i), y_i)$$\nWith $l(.,.)$ the cross-entropy loss and lambda the weights that maximize the weighted loss of protected groups. To solve this minmax problem, the authors set up a special architecture consisting of two neural networks, a learner and an adversary.\nThe Model Architecture As previously announced, the authors therefore decided to implement the Adversarial Reweighted Learning (ARL) approach, training two models alternately.\nThe learner optimizes for the main classification task, and aims to learn the best parameters θ that minimizes expected loss.\nThe adversary learns a function mapping $f_\\phi : X \\times Y \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ to computationally-identifiable regions with high loss, and makes an adversarial assignment of weight vector $\\lambda_\\phi : f_\\phi \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ so as to maximize the expected loss.\nThe learner then adjusts itself to minimize the adversarial loss: $$J(\\theta, \\phi) = min_{\\theta} max_{\\phi} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_{\\phi}(x_i, y_i) \\cdot l_{ce}(h_\\theta(x_i), y_i)$$\nTo ensure that the loss function is well defined, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to introduce specific constraints on the weights used in the loss function. Ensuring these weights are non-negative, prevent zero values to include all training examples, and are normalized, addresses potential instability and promotes uniform contribution across the dataset.\n$$\\lambda_{\\phi}(x_i, y_i) = 1 + n \\cdot \\frac{f_{\\phi}(x_i, y_i)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_{\\phi}(x_i, y_i)}$$\nThe authors have implemented these two networks using standard feed-forward network. The learner is a fully connected two-layer feed-forward network with 64 and 32 hidden units in the hidden layers, with ReLU activation function. For small datasets, the adversary which performs the best is a linear model.\nResults analysis This section provides a detailed examination of the results obtained from our implementation of the Adversarial Reweighted Learning (ARL) model. We replicate the experiments conducted by Lahoti et al. and present the outcomes of our implementation. Furthermore, we analyze the significance of the results through a comprehensive evaluation.\nReproducibility We first reproduce the results reported by Lahoti et al. using their TensorFlow implementation. However, due to the absence of optimal hyperparameters, we utilize default parameters for our runs. As a result, our AUC scores are lower than those reported in the original paper. For instance, the average AUC for the Adult dataset in Lahoti et al.\u0026rsquo;s work is 0.907, whereas our run yields an AUC of 0.497. Similarly, for the LSAC dataset, Lahoti et al. report an AUC of 0.823, whereas we obtain 0.518. The COMPAS dataset also exhibits a similar trend, with Lahoti et al. reporting an AUC of 0.748, compared to our result of 0.536. Subsequent experimentation with optimal parameters from TensorFlow implementation demonstrates improved performance, although AUC scores remain lower than those presented in the original paper.\nReplicability We replicate the experiments using our PyTorch implementation of the ARL model with optimal hyperparameters obtained through grid-search. Comparing the AUC scores with Lahoti et al.\u0026rsquo;s results reveals close alignment for the Adult and LSAC datasets. However, a slightly larger difference is observed for the COMPAS dataset. Notably, all AUC metrics for the COMPAS dataset are lower than the baseline model presented by Lahoti et al. This discrepancy suggests potential challenges with dataset size, leading to increased variance in results. Nonetheless, our PyTorch implementation demonstrates consistency with Lahoti et al.\u0026rsquo;s findings, highlighting the robustness of the ARL model across different implementations.\nSignificance Evaluation We conduct significance tests to evaluate the performance improvement of our PyTorch-implemented ARL model compared to a simple baseline model. Despite observing notable improvements in fairness metrics, none of the p-values obtained are less than 0.05. Consequently, according to established significance criteria, the performance enhancement achieved by our ARL model is not statistically significant. This finding underscores the need for further investigation into the efficacy of adversarial learning methods in enhancing fairness without demographic information.\nConclusion In this study, we critically examined the paper \u0026ldquo;Fairness without Demographics through Adversarially Reweighted Learning\u0026rdquo; by Lahoti et al., focusing on reproducibility, replicability, and the significance of reported results. While encountering challenges in reproducing Lahoti et al.\u0026rsquo;s results due to parameter settings and dataset characteristics, we successfully replicated the experiments using our PyTorch implementation. Despite demonstrating consistency with the original findings, our significance tests indicate a lack of statistical significance in the performance improvement achieved by the ARL model. This prompts further inquiry into the suitability of adversarial learning approaches for addressing fairness concerns in machine learning without relying on demographic data.\nAnnexes References [1] Lahoti, P., Beutel, A., Chen, J., Lee, K., Prost, F., Thain, N., Wang, X., \u0026amp; Chi, E.

Despite observing notable improvements in fairness metrics, none of the p-values obtained are less than 0.05. Consequently, according to established significance criteria, the performance enhancement achieved by our ARL model is not statistically significant. This finding underscores the need for further investigation into the efficacy of adversarial learning methods in enhancing fairness without demographic information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"section-9\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this study, we critically examined the paper \u0026ldquo;Fairness without Demographics through Adversarially Reweighted Learning\u0026rdquo; by Lahoti et al., focusing on reproducibility, replicability, and the significance of reported results. While encountering challenges in reproducing Lahoti et al.\u0026rsquo;s results due to parameter settings and dataset characteristics, we successfully replicated the experiments using our PyTorch implementation. Despite demonstrating consistency with the original findings, our significance tests indicate a lack of statistical significance in the performance improvement achieved by the ARL model. This prompts further inquiry into the suitability of adversarial learning approaches for addressing fairness concerns in machine learning without relying on demographic data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"annexes\"\u003eAnnexes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"references\"\u003eReferences\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[1] Lahoti, P., Beutel, A., Chen, J., Lee, K., Prost, F., Thain, N., Wang, X., \u0026amp; Chi, E.

Imagine, you\u0026rsquo;re quietly at home when the doorbell rings. You open the door and a government official appears: population census. Even though he shows you his official badge and you\u0026rsquo;d like to help him in the public interest, you find it hard to answer his questions as you go along. Indeed, the first questions about the date of your move are easy and public. On the other hand, when he asks about the number of children, marital status or your salary and what you do with it, you struggle. Not because you don\u0026rsquo;t know the answer, but because you\u0026rsquo;re faced with an ethical dilemma: transparency towards the state versus protection of personal data.\n$$\\text{In short, transparency goes against your privacy. }$$\nThis stress has major consequences: as you doubt what could happen to you with this data, but you still want to answer it, you underestimate your answers. On a wider scale, this leads to a suffrage bias and therefore a lack of knowledge of the real situation of your population. Warner [1], the first to tackle this problem from a statistical angle talks of an evasive bias and says:\n\u0026ldquo;for reasons of modesty, fear of being thought bigoted, or merely a reluctance to confide secrets to strangers, respondents to surveys might prefer to be able to answer certain questions non-truthfully, or at least without the interviewer knowing their true response\u0026rdquo;\nThis situation presented a trusted agent, in that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t trying to harm you directly. Now imagine that you agree to give him your personal data, but that on the way home, this agent of the state is mugged and someone steals his documents. Not only is this an attack on his person, it\u0026rsquo;s also an attack on yours: as the guarantor of your data, it\u0026rsquo;s now at the mercy of the attacker. The problem here is not to have protected yourself against a malicious agent.\nAdmittedly, these situations are rare, but with the densification of data, their analogies are omnipresent: cookies on the Internet, cyber-attacks, datacenter crashes\u0026hellip;One area for improvement is quite simply to better certify usage by means of cyber protection labels and leads to such a norm to achieve trust: In this blog, we propose to tackle this problem from a completely different angle: how to both enable the agent to take global measures and prevent it and any subsequent malicious agents from being able to re-identify my personal data. We\u0026rsquo;ll also use minimax bounds to answer the question: for a given privacy criterion, what\u0026rsquo;s the loss in terms of estimation? (fundamental trade-offs between privacy and convergence rate)\nScientific introduction Our blog will follow the same plan as the article that inspired it (John C. Duchi [2]),i.e. to show that response randomization achieves optimal convergence in the case of multinomial estimation, and then that this process can be generalized to any nonparametric distribution estimation. To this end, we will introduce the notion of local differential privacy as well as the minimax theory for obtaining optimal limits. All this will shed light on the trade-off between privacy and estimation rates. We will also explain algorithms to implement these optimal strategies. Finally, we will propose some experimental results.\nSome key definitions Let assume that you want to make private $X_1 , \u0026hellip; , X_n \\in X$ random variable and, as the statistician, you only observe $Z_1, . . . , Z_n ∈ Z$. The paper assumes that there exist a markov kernel that links the true ramdom variables and the observed ones as follow: $Q_i(Z_i | X_i = x)$.\nThe privacy mechanism is to be said non interactive if each $Z_i$ is obtained only conditionnaly on $X_i$ (and not on the others). This represents the fact that the privacy mechanism is memory less. If not, the mechnism is said to be interactive.\nIn the following, we will work only with non-interactive privacy mechanism but in the conlusion we will claim that newer studies showed that it is not enough for some larger problems.\n$Z_i$ is said to be α-local-differentially private for the original data $X_i$ if $$sup(\\frac{Q(Z | X_i = x)}{Q(Z | X_i = x\u0026rsquo;)} | x, x\u0026rsquo; ∈ X) ≤ exp(α)$$.\nAn intuitive way of understanding this definition is to see that the smaller α is (the more private it is), the more difficult it is to distinguish the distribution of Z conditional on two different X data.\nTheoretical results The case of multinomial estimation In this section, we return back to the problem of the private survey. For the statistician view, estimating a survey is estimating the parameter θ from the Bernouilli distribution $B(θ)$. This problem is a special case of multinomial estimation, where θ is now a multidimensional parameter that is amenable to simplex probability. $∆d := (θ ∈ ℝ+ |∑θ_j = 1)$.\nTheorem : Given α-local-differentially private $Z_i$, there exists some arbitrary constants $C_1$, $C_2$ such that for all $\\alpha\\in [0,1]$: $$C_1 min(1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n\\alpha^2}}, \\frac{d}{n\\alpha^2}) ≤ E[|θ_{hat} - θ|^2] ≤ C_2 min(1, \\frac{d}{n\\alpha^2})$$ and $$C_1 min(1,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n\\alpha^2}}) ≤ E[||θ_{hat} - θ||_1] ≤ C_2 min(1,\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{n\\alpha^2}})$$.\nRecall from standard statistics: For non private independant $Z_i$ with finite variance, there exists some arbitrary constants $C_3$ such that: $$E[|θ_{hat} - θ|^2] ≤ \\frac{C_3}{n}$$\nIn others term, providing α-local-differentially privacy causes a reduction in the effective sample size of a factor $\\frac{\\alpha^2}{d}$ for best situations. It thus means that the asymptotically rate of convergences remains unchanged which is a really good news !\nPractical strategies The paper deals with one of the 2 standard methods to implement such a strategy that obtains the minimax rates:\nRandomized responses Laplace Noise (beyond paper) Randomized responses The intuition of this section is the following : to not allow the statistician to retrieve your personnal data in case of Bernouilli distribution, you toss a coin. If it is heads, you say to him your reel answer, if it is tails, you say the opposite. In his point of view, as he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what was the result of the coin, he can\u0026rsquo;t distinguish if you tell the true or not but in a large scale, he knows that he will have half correct answer, half lies so that he can retrieve information.\nFor the multinomial estimation now, you will generalize this procedure to the multidimensionnal setting. For each coordinate, you will tell to the statistician the reel answer with a certain probability and lies otherwise. More precisely, its leads to :\n$$[Z]_j = x_j \\text{ with probability } \\frac{e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} {1 + e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$$ $$[Z]_j = 1 - x_j \\text{ with probability } \\frac{1}{1 + e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$$\nSuch a mechanism achieves α-local-differentially privacy because one can show that :\n$$\\frac{Q(Z = z | x)}{Q(Z = z | x\u0026rsquo;)} = e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2}(||z - x||_1 - ||z - x\u0026rsquo;||_1) \\in [e^{-\\alpha}, e^\\alpha]$$ which is the criteria given above.\nWith the notation as $1_d=[1, 1, 1, \u0026hellip;, 1]$ corresponds to a d-vector with each coordinate equals 1, we can also show that :\n$$E[Z | x] = \\frac{e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2} - 1}{e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2} + 1} * x + \\frac{1}{1 + e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}1_d$$\nThis leads to the natural moment-estimator :\n$$θ_{hat} = \\frac{1}{n} ∑_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{Z_i - 1_d}{1 + e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} * \\frac{e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2} + 1}{e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2} - 1}$$\nOne can also show that it verifies :\n$$E[ ||θ_{hat}- θ||_2] ≤ \\frac{d}{n} * \\frac{(e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2} + 1)^2}{(e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2} - 1)^2} \u0026lt; \\frac{C_3}{nα^2}$$ which is the announced result.\nLaplace Noise (beyond paper) Instead of saying the truth with some probability, one may think of adding noise to the answer so that the statistician can\u0026rsquo;t retrieve his real answer. This is exactly the mechanism we propose to dive in and which is not covered in the paper.\nDefinition: A noise is said to be a Laplace noise with parameters (μ, b) if it verifies:\n$$f(x|μ, b) = \\frac{1}{2b} * exp(\\frac{-|x - μ|}{b})$$\nA visualisation for differents parameters is given below. We can see that Laplace distribution is a shaper verson of the gaussian distribution : The trick is to use such a noise. Let assume $X_i \\in [-M,M]$ and construct the private mechanism as follow:\n$$Z_i = X_i + \\sigma W_i$$ where $W_i$ is drawn from a Laplace noise (0,1).\nOne can show that :\n$$\\frac{Q(Z = z | x)}{Q(Z = z | x\u0026rsquo;)} \\leq e^{\\frac{1}{\\sigma} * |x - x\u0026rsquo;|} \\leq e^{\\frac{2M}{\\sigma}}$$\nThus, with the choice of $\\sigma = \\frac{2M}{\\alpha}$, it verifies α-local-differentially privacy. The proposed estimator is the following :\n$$\\hat{Z} = \\bar{X} + \\frac{2M}{\\alpha} \\bar{W}$$\nOne can show that it is an unbiaised estimator that achieves the optimal rates:\n$$E[\\hat{Z}] = E[X]$$\n$$V[\\hat{Z}] = \\frac{V(X)}{n} + \\frac{4M^2}{n\\alpha^2} V[\\bar{W}] = \\frac{V(X)}{n} + \\frac{8M^2}{n\\alpha^2}$$ $$E[ |\\hat{Z}- X|^2] \\leq \\frac{C_3}{n\\alpha^2}.$$\nThis is exactly the optimal rates, quite outstanding !\nThe case of density estimation One accurate question that can raise is : what about others distribution ? Is privacy more costly in general cases ? What is the trade-off ?\nTo answer this question, let\u0026rsquo;s precise the problem.\nWe want to estimate in a non-parametric way a 1D-density function f belonging to one of theses classes :\n-Hölder Class (β, L): $\\text{For all }x, y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\text{ and } m \\leq \\beta, \\quad \\left| f^{(m)}(x) - f^{(m)}(y) \\right| \\leq L \\left| x - y \\right|^{\\beta - m}$\n-Sobolev Class: $F_{\\beta}[C] := \\left( f \\in L^2([0, 1]) , \\middle| , f = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\theta_j \\phi_j \\text{ such that } \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} j^{2\\beta} \\phi_j^2 \\leq C^2 \\right)$\nIn a intuitition way, those two classes express that f is smooth enough to admits Lipschitz constant to its derivative so that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;vary\u0026rdquo; locally too much.\nTheorem Without privacy One can show that without privacy, the minimax rate achievable for estimating a Hölder Class function is:\n$$\\text{MSE}(\\hat{f} - f) \\leq C_1 \\cdot n^{-\\frac{2\\beta}{1+2\\beta}}$$ with the estimator\n$$\\hat{f}(x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{h} K\\left(\\frac{x - X_i}{h}\\right) \\text{with } h = C_2 \\cdot n^{-\\frac{1}{2\\beta+1}}$$\nIn the case of d-multidimensionnal density f, the optimal rate is :\n$$\\text{MSE}(\\hat{f} - f) \\leq C_4 \\cdot n^{-\\frac{2\\beta}{d+ 2\\beta}}$$ with the estimator\n$$\\hat{f}(x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{h^d} K^d\\left(\\frac{x-X_i}{h}\\right) \\quad \\text{with} \\quad h = C_5 \\cdot n^{-\\frac{1}{2\\beta + d}}$$\nThis illustrates once again the curse of dimensionnality.\nWith privacy Let assume that f bellongs to one of the two classes with β as smoothness parameter.\nThen, the optimal α-local-differentially private optimal rate is :\n$$\\text{MSE}(\\hat{f} - f) \\leq C_1 \\cdot (n\\alpha^2)^{-\\frac{2\\beta}{2\\beta+2}}.$$\nOne may observe two pessimistic news:\n-The rate is affected by a factor of $\\alpha^2$ as for the multinomial estimation\n-More damageable: the rate is slower in term of n unlike the previous problem which make privacy in this case more costly.\nPractical strategies Eventhough this rate is pessimistic and proves that privacy comes at a cost, it remains to illustrates how can we achieves this best but not great rate. For this end, once again, two strategies are possible.\nRandomized responses Laplace Noise (beyond paper) Randomized responses This is the strategy illustrated in the paper and consists of sampling for each coordinate according the realisation of a Bernouilli variable with the correct probability as function of α. As it is not the most comprehensive and straightforward method, we prefer to dive in depth into the second one; uncovered in the paper.\nLaplace Noise (beyond paper) Let assume that $X_i \\in [0,M]$ almost surely. We note $G_j = [\\frac{j-1}{K},\\quad \\frac{j}{K}]$ the bin of length $\\frac{1}{K}$.\nWe consider the histogramm estimator: $$\\hat{f}(x) = \\frac{K}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1_{X_i \\in G_j} \\cdot 1_{x \\in G_j}.$$\nWe now construct the private mechanism as follow:\n$$Z_i = \\left[1_{X_i \\in G_1} + \\frac{2}{\\alpha} W_1, \\ldots, 1_{X_i \\in G_K} + \\frac{2}{\\alpha} W_K\\right]$$\nIn an intuitive way, we add a Laplace noise realisation for each bin.\nThis guarantees α-local-differentially privacy as : $$\\frac{Q(Z = z | x)}{Q(Z = z | x\u0026rsquo;)} \\leq \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{K} |1_{x \\in G_j} - 1_{x\u0026rsquo; \\in G_j}| \\right) \\leq \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\cdot 2\\right).$$\nThis leads to the α-local-differentially private estimator :\n$$f_{\\text{private_estimate}} = \\hat{f} + \\frac{2K}{n\\alpha} \\sum_{j=1}^{K} W_j$$\nThe biais is the same as the unprivate case as :\n$$E[f_{\\text{private_estimate}}] = E[\\hat{f}] + 0 .$$\nOne may prove that if f bellongs to the β-Hölder Class:\n$$Biais(f_{\\text{private_estimate}}, f) \\leq C_1 * K^{-\\beta}$$\nMeanwhile, $$V[f_{\\text{private_estimate}}] \\leq \\frac{C_2}{n} + \\frac{4K^2}{\\alpha^2} \\frac{V[W]}{n}$$, such that in total :\n$$\\text{MSE}(f_{\\text{private_estimate}} - f) \\leq C_1 K^{-2\\beta} + \\frac{C_2}{n} + \\frac{C_3 K^2}{n\\alpha^2}.$$ Minimizing over K (hyperparameters) leads to : $K = C_4 \\cdot (n\\alpha^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2\\beta+2}}$ and thus to:\n$$\\text{MSE}(f_{\\text{private_estimate}} - f) \\leq C_5 \\cdot (n\\alpha^2)^{-\\frac{2\\beta}{2\\beta + 2}}$$, which is the expected bound.\nExperiment: Illustration of the Minimax privacy rate Overview The aim of this section is to provide illustrations of the theoretical results set out above. Emphasis is placed on convergence results, with empirical confirmation of the latter.\nFor the sake of reproducibility and transparency, the source code can be found in the notebook at this: Github link.\nMethodology Data Preparation: Rather than working with real datasets, we decide to work with simulated data, as this allows us to maintain control over all aspects. More precisely, we give ourselves $n=1000$ samples of the normal distribution $N(100,1)$ on which we add a Laplace noise $L(0,\\alpha).$\nAs for the different alpha values, we iterate through them: $[0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7]$\nPrivacy Metric Calculation: We will look at the use case of estimating the mean of a distribution.\nEvaluation: The results will be compared in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE).\nResults In terms of the observed distribution (private because subject to Laplace noise) relative to the true data, we obtain the following figure:\nAs expected, the greater the desired privacy (low $\\alpha$), the more spread out the distribution of observed data.\nWhen it comes to estimating the true average from private data, we obtain the following figure:\nThis figure illustrates two major points:\n-The first is that whatever the level of privacy, we have an unbiased estimator of the mean. It\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful property, empirically verified !\n-The second is that, unfortunately, the greater the privacy (low alpha), the greater the variance of this estimator.\nWe recall our main theorem demonstrated above Previous theorem :\nTheorem : Given α-local-differentially private $Z_i$, there exists some arbitrary constants $C_1$, $C_2$ such that for all $\\alpha\\in [0,1]$: $$C_1 min(1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n\\alpha^2}}, \\frac{d}{n\\alpha^2}) ≤ E[|θ_{hat} - θ|^2] ≤ C_2 min(1, \\frac{d}{n\\alpha^2})$$\nWe now want to compare the theoretical optimal rate with empirical results. To do this, we distinguish two situations:\n-The first is with fixed alpha, and determines the MSE as a function of the number of samples n. This leads to these empirical results:\nThe dotted line represents the regime of the theoretical bound of the form $n \\rightarrow \\frac{C1}{n}$ . This is the shape of the empirical curves!\n-The second has a fixed n and determines the MSE as a function of alpha. This leads to these empirical results:\nThe dotted line represents the regime of the theoretical bound of the form $\\alpha \\rightarrow \\frac{C1}{\\alpha^2}$ . This is once again the shape of the empirical curves quite surprisingly!\nConclusion From a problem rooted in an ethical dilemma (privacy versus completeness and transparency), we have looked at the cost of guaranteeing one at the expense of the other, to better sketch out desirable situations.\nThis has enabled us to develop theoretical results in terms of minimax rates. There is indeed a trade-off between these criteria, which is even more costly in the case of non-parametric density estimation.\nFinally, we have compared these theoretical limits with empirical results, which confirm the conformity of the statements.\nThe aim of all this work is to disseminate this important yet under-exploited notion: privacy. To this end, we invite the reader to take the following quiz to ensure his or her understanding.\nQuizz To test yourself abour privacy:\nWhat is privacy?\nAvoid asking questions that can raise private information A mechanism that prevents other agent to retrieve personnal information in your answer An ethical-washing trend Which situation is α-local-differentially privacy?\nsup {Q(Z | Xi = x)/Q(Z | Xi = x')} | x, x' ∈ X} \u003e= exp(α) You tell the truth half the time, you lie otherwise. Z_i = X_i + (2M/α) W_i with W_i drawn from a Laplace Noise(0,1) What is the privacy cost in term of optimal rate ?\nMultinomial estimation: A factor α^2/d Density estimation: from n^(-2β/2β+2) (without privacy) to (nα^2)^(-2β/(2β+2)) We loose nothing, that's the surprising finding of the paper Submit Annexes References Warner SL.

You open the door and a government official appears: population census. Even though he shows you his official badge and you\u0026rsquo;d like to help him in the public interest, you find it hard to answer his questions as you go along. Indeed, the first questions about the date of your move are easy and public. On the other hand, when he asks about the number of children, marital status or your salary and what you do with it, you \u003cem\u003estruggle\u003c/em\u003e. Not because you don\u0026rsquo;t know the answer, but because you\u0026rsquo;re faced with an \u003cstrong\u003eethical dilemma\u003c/strong\u003e: transparency towards the state versus protection of personal data.\u003cbr\u003e\n$$\\text{In short, transparency goes against your privacy. }$$\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis stress has major consequences: as you doubt what could happen to you with this data, but you still want to answer it, you \u003cstrong\u003eunderestimate\u003c/strong\u003e your answers. On a wider scale, this leads to a \u003cstrong\u003esuffrage bias\u003c/strong\u003e and therefore a lack of knowledge of the real situation of your population. Warner [1], the first to tackle this problem from a statistical angle talks of an evasive bias and says:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;for reasons of modesty, fear of being thought bigoted, or merely a reluctance to confide secrets to strangers, respondents to surveys might prefer to be able to answer certain questions non-truthfully, or at least without the interviewer knowing their true response\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis situation presented a trusted agent, in that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t trying to harm you directly. Now imagine that you agree to give him your personal data, but that on the way home, this agent of the state is mugged and someone steals his documents. Not only is this an attack on his person, it\u0026rsquo;s also an attack on yours: as the guarantor of your data, it\u0026rsquo;s now at the mercy of the attacker. The problem here is \u003cstrong\u003enot to have protected yourself against a malicious agent\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmittedly, these situations are rare, but with the densification of data, their analogies are omnipresent: cookies on the Internet, cyber-attacks, datacenter crashes\u0026hellip;One area for improvement is quite simply to better \u003cstrong\u003ecertify usage\u003c/strong\u003e by means of cyber protection labels and leads to such a norm to achieve trust:\n\u003cimg\n  src=\"/images/Antoine_Klein/Umbrella.png\"\n  alt=\"Data Privacy2\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  decoding=\"async\"\n  class=\"full-width\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this blog, we propose to tackle this problem from a completely different angle: \u003cstrong\u003ehow to both enable the agent to take global measures and prevent it and any subsequent malicious agents from being able to re-identify my personal data\u003c/strong\u003e.

To this end, we will introduce the notion of \u003cstrong\u003elocal differential privacy\u003c/strong\u003e as well as the \u003cstrong\u003eminimax theory\u003c/strong\u003e for obtaining optimal limits. All this will shed light on the \u003cstrong\u003etrade-off between privacy and estimation rates\u003c/strong\u003e. We will also explain algorithms to implement these optimal strategies.

The paper assumes that there exist a \u003cstrong\u003emarkov kernel\u003c/strong\u003e that links the true ramdom variables and the observed ones as follow: $Q_i(Z_i | X_i = x)$.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe privacy mechanism is to be said \u003cstrong\u003enon interactive\u003c/strong\u003e if each $Z_i$ is obtained only conditionnaly on $X_i$ (and not on the others). This represents the fact that the privacy mechanism is \u003cstrong\u003ememory less\u003c/strong\u003e.

To this end, we invite the reader to take the following \u003cstrong\u003equiz\u003c/strong\u003e to ensure his or her understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"section-8\"\u003eQuizz\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo test yourself abour privacy:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cform id=\"quiz-form\" class=\"quiz-form\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"quiz-question\"\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eWhat is privacy?\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"quiz-options\"\u003e\n            \u003clabel\u003e\n                \u003cinput type=\"radio\" name=\"question1\" value=\"1\"\u003e\n                Avoid asking questions that can raise private information\n            \u003c/label\u003e\n            \u003clabel\u003e\n                \u003cinput type=\"radio\" name=\"question1\" value=\"2\"\u003e\n                A mechanism that prevents other agent to retrieve personnal information in your answer\n            \u003c/label\u003e\n            \u003clabel\u003e\n                \u003cinput type=\"radio\" name=\"question1\" value=\"3\"\u003e\n                An ethical-washing trend\n            \u003c/label\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eWhich situation is α-local-differentially privacy?\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"quiz-options\"\u003e\n            \u003clabel\u003e\n                \u003cinput type=\"radio\" name=\"question2\" value=\"1\"\u003e\n                sup {Q(Z | Xi = x)/Q(Z | Xi = x')} | x, x' ∈ X} \u003e= exp(α)\n            \u003c/label\u003e\n            \u003clabel\u003e\n                \u003cinput type=\"radio\" name=\"question2\" value=\"2\"\u003e\n                You tell the truth half the time, you lie otherwise.\n            \u003c/label\u003e\n            \u003clabel\u003e\n                \u003cinput type=\"radio\" name=\"question2\" value=\"3\"\u003e\n                Z_i = X_i + (2M/α) W_i with W_i drawn from a Laplace Noise(0,1)\n            \u003c/label\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eWhat is the privacy cost in term of optimal rate ?\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"quiz-options\"\u003e\n            \u003clabel\u003e\n                \u003cinput type=\"radio\" name=\"question3\" value=\"1\"\u003e\n                Multinomial estimation: A factor α^2/d\n            \u003c/label\u003e\n            \u003clabel\u003e\n                \u003cinput type=\"radio\" name=\"question3\" value=\"2\"\u003e\n                Density estimation: from n^(-2β/2β+2) (without privacy) to (nα^2)^(-2β/(2β+2))\n            \u003c/label\u003e\n            \u003clabel\u003e\n                \u003cinput type=\"radio\" name=\"question3\" value=\"3\"\u003e\n                We loose nothing, that's the surprising finding of the paper\n            \u003c/label\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c!-- Add more quiz questions as needed --\u003e\n    \u003cbutton type=\"submit\" class=\"quiz-submit\"\u003eSubmit\u003c/button\u003e\n\u003c/form\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"quiz-results\" class=\"quiz-results\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cscript\u003e\n    // Define quiz questions and correct answers\n    const quizQuestions = [\n        {\n            question: \"What is privacy?\",\n            answer: \"2\"\n        },\n        //Add more quiz questions as needed\n        {\n            question: \"Which situation is α-local-differentially privacy?\",\n            answer: \"3\"\n        },\n        //Add more quiz questions as needed\n        {\n            question: \"What is the privacy cost in term of optimal rate ?\",\n            answer: \"1\"\n        }\n    ];\n\n    // Handle form submission\n    document.getElementById('quiz-form').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {\n        event.preventDefault();\n\n        // Calculate quiz score\n        let score = 0;\n        quizQuestions.forEach(question =\u003e {\n            const selectedAnswer = document.querySelector(`input[name=\"question${quizQuestions.indexOf(question) + 1}\"]:checked`);\n            if (selectedAnswer) {\n                if (selectedAnswer.value.toLowerCase() === question.answer) {\n                    score++;\n                    selectedAnswer.parentElement.classList.add('correct');\n                } else {\n                    selectedAnswer.parentElement.classList.add('incorrect');\n                }\n            }\n        });\n\n        // Display quiz results\n        const quizResults = document.getElementById('quiz-results');\n        quizResults.innerHTML = `\u003cp\u003eYou scored ${score} out of ${quizQuestions.length}.\u003c/p\u003e`;\n    });\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"annexes\"\u003eAnnexes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"references\"\u003eReferences\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWarner SL.
