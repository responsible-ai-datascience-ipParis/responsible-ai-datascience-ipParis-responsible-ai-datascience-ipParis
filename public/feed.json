Machine learning models are becoming increasingly capable of making advanced predictions. While models like linear regression are relatively easy to understand and explain, more complex models, often called \u0026ldquo;black boxes\u0026rdquo; due to their complexity, present challenges in explaining how they make predictions. These models can be problematic in highstakes applications such as healthcare, finance, and justice, where it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to justify decision-making. Additionally, in case of errors, it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand the origin in order to address and correct them.\n\u0026ldquo;Explainability is the cornerstone of trust in black box models; without it, they remain inscrutable and unreliable.\u0026rdquo; - Yoshua Bengio\nTo tackle this challenge, the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged, offering various methods to enhance model transparency. Post-Hoc explainability methods exist, which intervene after the model has generated its results, enabling users to comprehend the reasoning behind specific decisions or predictions. These methods supplement the predictions of black box models with diverse explanations of how they arrive at their predictions.\nWhile much of the work on explainability focuses on supervised models, where labels are available to interpret predictions, unsupervised learning models are trained without labels. This post will focus on these unsupervised, label-free cases. It is based on recent research conducted by Crabbé and van der Schaar in 2022, which explores the explainability of unsupervised models. They have developed two new methods to explain these complex models without labels. The first method highlights important features in the data, while the second identifies training examples that have the greatest impact on the model\u0026rsquo;s construction of representations.\nIntroduction The entire post is focused on the quest for explainability of unsupervised models. In these models, no labels are assigned to our data, rendering the understanding of the model even more complicated due to the absence of explicit guidance on what the model is learning. In the supervised setting, users know the meaning of the black-box output they are trying to interpret. However, this clarity is not always available in machine learning. Therefore, elucidating concepts such as feature importance and example importance provides insights into why the model makes certain decisions or identifies specific patterns in the data.\nExample importance refers to the significance or weight assigned by a model to individual examples (data points) within a dataset. In some models like decision trees or gradient boosting, each example may be assigned a weight based on its relevance or contribution to the overall learning process. These weights can influence how the model learns from the data and makes predictions.\nFeature importance helps in understanding which features have the most influence on the model\u0026rsquo;s predictions. For example, in a diabetes prediction scenario, it would reveal whether factors like the patient\u0026rsquo;s weight, age, or hair color exert the most influence on the prediction.\nWhen we identify the importance of examples and features, we gain insight into why the model made certain decisions.\nFeature Importance The feature importance method aims to explain the predictions of a black-box model by assigning an importance score to each feature (or attribute) of the input. This helps understand which features have the most influence on the model\u0026rsquo;s predictions. This method is developed based on a linear reasoning that is extended to label-free settings.\nTo understand how the label-free feature importance method works, let\u0026rsquo;s start by looking at the labeled case:\nLabelled Feature Importance\nThe method proposes to combine the importance scores of different components of the model\u0026rsquo;s output by weighting them with the associated class probabilities. For each component of the model\u0026rsquo;s output, we multiply the importance score of the corresponding feature by the probability of that component.\nThese weighted importance scores are then combined to obtain the final importance score of each feature.\nLet $ai(f_j;x)$ be the importance score of feature $x_i$ calculated with respect to the component $f_j$ of the model\u0026rsquo;s output. The method proposes to calculate the importance score $bi(f;x)$ for feature $x_i$ as follows:\n$bi(f;x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{d_Y} f_j(x) \\times ai(f_j;x)$\nHere, $f_j(x)$ represents the probability of class $j$, and $ai(f_j;x)$ is the importance score of feature $x_i$ for class $j$.\nBy weighting each importance score by the probability of the corresponding class, we take into account the contribution of each class to the overall importance of the feature. We can see that in the labeled case, the method is quite clear. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s move on to the label-free setting.\nLabel-Free Feature Importance\nIn this context, we consider a latent space $H$ of dimension $d_H$ where a black-box model $f:X \\rightarrow H$ is given. The goal is to assign an importance score to each feature of the input $x$, even if the dimensions of the latent space have no clear relations with the labels.\nWe use a similar weighting formula for importance scores, where the components $f_j(x)$ do not correspond to probabilities but to neuron activations. The weighted sum is considered as an inner product in the latent space.\nThe method is developed using linear feature importance functions, and it retains the completeness property, meaning that the sum of importance scores equals the black-box prediction up to a baseline constant.\nThis approach provides a systematic way to compute feature importance in both labeled and label-free contexts, by using existing feature importance methods and adapting them to the specific context.\nExemple Importance In this section, we discuss how we adapt methods for assessing the importance of individual training examples to a label-free scenario. These methods aim to quantify the impact of removing a specific example from the training dataset on the model\u0026rsquo;s performance.\nLoss-Based Example Importance:\nIn supervised settings, loss-based methods evaluate the effect of removing an example by observing how it influences the model\u0026rsquo;s loss on a test example. Essentially, if removing an example leads to an increase in loss, it\u0026rsquo;s considered important, and vice versa. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n$$ c_n(f_r; x) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} r^T \\left( L(z; \\theta\u0026rsquo;) - L(z_n; \\theta\u0026rsquo;) \\right) $$\nWhere:\n$ c_n(f_r; x) $ is the importance score for example $ x_n $. $ f_r $ represents the relevant parameters of the model. $ L(z; \\theta\u0026rsquo;) $ is the loss function evaluated on the test example $ z $. $ L(z_n; \\theta\u0026rsquo;) $ is the loss function evaluated on the test example after removing $ x_n $. $ r $ is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model\u0026rsquo;s parameters. $ N $ is the total number of examples in the training set. Representation-Based Example Importance:\nThese methods analyze the latent representations of training examples to assess their importance. In supervised settings, this involves comparing a test example\u0026rsquo;s representation with those of the training set. The affinity between them is quantified by reconstructing the test example\u0026rsquo;s representation using a weighted combination of training representations. The weights are typically determined based on the nearest neighbors in the latent space or learned through optimization.\nIn the label-free setting, we can directly apply representation-based methods without modification, as they only rely on the latent representations learned by the model.\nOverall, these methods provide insights into which training examples have the most influence on the model\u0026rsquo;s behavior, facilitating model interpretation and understanding.\nExperiments: Evaluation and Results Overview In this section, we will retest and show you the results of the experiments presented in the report to evaluate the label-free extensions of various explanation methods for unsupervised models. The experiment is divided into two main parts: consistency checks and comparisons of representations learned from different pretext tasks. Nos test vont se concentrer sur la dataset MNIST.\nConclusion In this post you learned about label-free explainability a new framework developped by Crabbé and van der Schaar in 2022, wich extend linear feature importance and example importance methods to the unsupervised setting with a focus on the MNIST dataset.\nReferences Crabbé, J. \u0026amp; van der Schaar, M..

Imagine, you\u0026rsquo;re quietly at home when the doorbell rings. You open the door and a government official appears: population census. Even though he shows you his official badge and you\u0026rsquo;d like to help him in the public interest, you find it hard to answer his questions as you go along. Indeed, the first questions about the date of your move are easy and public. On the other hand, when he asks about the number of children, marital status or your salary and what you do with it, you struggle. Not because you don\u0026rsquo;t know the answer, but because you\u0026rsquo;re faced with an ethical dilemma: transparency towards the state versus protection of personal data.\n$$\\text{In short, transparency goes against your privacy. }$$\nThis stress has major consequences: as you doubt what could happen to you with this data, but you still want to answer it, you underestimate your answers. On a wider scale, this leads to a suffrage bias and therefore a lack of knowledge of the real situation of your population. Warner [1], the first to tackle this problem from a statistical angle talks of an evasive bias and says:\n\u0026ldquo;for reasons of modesty, fear of being thought bigoted, or merely a reluctance to confide secrets to strangers, respondents to surveys might prefer to be able to answer certain questions non-truthfully, or at least without the interviewer knowing their true response\u0026rdquo;\nThis situation presented a trusted agent, in that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t trying to harm you directly. Now imagine that you agree to give him your personal data, but that on the way home, this agent of the state is mugged and someone steals his documents. Not only is this an attack on his person, it\u0026rsquo;s also an attack on yours: as the guarantor of your data, it\u0026rsquo;s now at the mercy of the attacker. The problem here is not to have protected yourself against a malicious agent.\nAdmittedly, these situations are rare, but with the densification of data, their analogies are omnipresent: cookies on the Internet, cyber-attacks, datacenter crashes\u0026hellip;One area for improvement is quite simply to better certify usage by means of cyber protection labels and leads to such a norm to achieve trust: In this blog, we propose to tackle this problem from a completely different angle: how to both enable the agent to take global measures and prevent it and any subsequent malicious agents from being able to re-identify my personal data. We\u0026rsquo;ll also use minimax bounds to answer the question: for a given privacy criterion, what\u0026rsquo;s the loss in terms of estimation? (fundamental trade-offs between privacy and convergence rate)\nScientific introduction Our blog will follow the same plan as the article that inspired it (John C. Duchi [2]),i.e. to show that response randomization achieves optimal convergence in the case of multinomial estimation, and then that this process can be generalized to any nonparametric distribution estimation. To this end, we will introduce the notion of local differential privacy as well as the minimax theory for obtaining optimal limits. All this will shed light on the trade-off between privacy and estimation rates. We will also explain algorithms to implement these optimal strategies. Finally, we will propose some experimental results.\nSome key definitions Let assume that you want to make private $X_1 , \u0026hellip; , X_n \\in X$ random variable and, as the statistician, you only observe $Z_1, . . . , Z_n ∈ Z$. The paper assumes that there exist a markov kernel that links the true ramdom variables and the observed ones as follow: $Q_i(Z_i | X_i = x)$.\nThe privacy mechanism is to be said non interactive if each $Z_i$ is obtained only conditionnaly on $X_i$ (and not on the others). This represents the fact that the privacy mechanism is memory less. If not, the mechnism is said to be interactive.\nIn the following, we will work only with non-interactive privacy mechanism but in the conlusion we will claim that newer studies showed that it is not enough for some larger problems.\n$Z_i$ is said to be α-local-differentially private for the original data $X_i$ if $$sup(\\frac{Q(Z | X_i = x)}{Q(Z | X_i = x\u0026rsquo;)} | x, x\u0026rsquo; ∈ X) ≤ exp(α)$$.\nAn intuitive way of understanding this definition is to see that the smaller α is (the more private it is), the more difficult it is to distinguish the distribution of Z conditional on two different X data.\nTheoretical results The case of multinomial estimation In this section, we return back to the problem of the private survey. For the statistician view, estimating a survey is estimating the parameter θ from the Bernouilli distribution $B(θ)$. This problem is a special case of multinomial estimation, where θ is now a multidimensional parameter that is amenable to simplex probability. $∆d := (θ ∈ ℝ+ |∑θ_j = 1)$.\nTheorem : Given α-local-differentially private $Z_i$, there exists some arbitrary constants $C_1$, $C_2$ such that for all $\\alpha\\in [0,1]$: $$C_1 min(1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n\\alpha^2}}, \\frac{d}{n\\alpha^2}) ≤ E[|θ_{hat} - θ|^2] ≤ C_2 min(1, \\frac{d}{n\\alpha^2})$$ and $$C_1 min(1,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n\\alpha^2}}) ≤ E[||θ_{hat} - θ||_1] ≤ C_2 min(1,\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{n\\alpha^2}})$$.\nRecall from standard statistics: For non private independant $Z_i$ with finite variance, there exists some arbitrary constants $C_3$ such that: $$E[|θ_{hat} - θ|^2] ≤ \\frac{C_3}{n}$$\nIn others term, providing α-local-differentially privacy causes a reduction in the effective sample size of a factor $\\frac{\\alpha^2}{d}$ for best situations. It thus means that the asymptotically rate of convergences remains unchanged which is a really good news !\nPractical strategies The paper deals with one of the 2 standard methods to implement such a strategy that obtains the minimax rates:\nRandomized responses Laplace Noise (beyond paper) Randomized responses The intuition of this section is the following : to not allow the statistician to retrieve your personnal data in case of Bernouilli distribution, you toss a coin. If it is heads, you say to him your reel answer, if it is tails, you say the opposite. In his point of view, as he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what was the result of the coin, he can\u0026rsquo;t distinguish if you tell the true or not but in a large scale, he knows that he will have half correct answer, half lies so that he can retrieve information.\nFor the multinomial estimation now, you will generalize this procedure to the multidimensionnal setting. For each coordinate, you will tell to the statistician the reel answer with a certain probability and lies otherwise. More precisely, its leads to :\n$$[Z]_j = x_j \\text{ with probability } \\frac{e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} {1 + e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$$ $$[Z]_j = 1 - x_j \\text{ with probability } \\frac{1}{1 + e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$$\nSuch a mechanism achieves α-local-differentially privacy because one can show that :\n$$\\frac{Q(Z = z | x)}{Q(Z = z | x\u0026rsquo;)} = e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2}(||z - x||_1 - ||z - x\u0026rsquo;||_1) \\in [e^{-\\alpha}, e^\\alpha]$$ which is the criteria given above.\nWith the notation as $1_d=[1, 1, 1, \u0026hellip;, 1]$ corresponds to a d-vector with each coordinate equals 1, we can also show that :\n$$E[Z | x] = \\frac{e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2} - 1}{e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2} + 1} * x + \\frac{1}{1 + e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}1_d$$\nThis leads to the natural moment-estimator :\n$$θ_{hat} = \\frac{1}{n} ∑_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{Z_i - 1_d}{1 + e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} * \\frac{e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2} + 1}{e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2} - 1}$$\nOne can also show that it verifies :\n$$E[ ||θ_{hat}- θ||_2] ≤ \\frac{d}{n} * \\frac{(e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2} + 1)^2}{(e^\\frac{\\alpha}{2} - 1)^2} \u0026lt; \\frac{C_3}{nα^2}$$ which is the announced result.\nLaplace Noise (beyond paper) Instead of saying the truth with some probability, one may think of adding noise to the answer so that the statistician can\u0026rsquo;t retrieve his real answer. This is exactly the mechanism we propose to dive in and which is not covered in the paper.\nDefinition: A noise is said to be a Laplace noise with parameters (μ, b) if it verifies:\n$$f(x|μ, b) = \\frac{1}{2b} * exp(\\frac{-|x - μ|}{b})$$\nA visualisation for differents parameters is given below. We can see that Laplace distribution is a shaper verson of the gaussian distribution : The trick is to use such a noise. Let assume $X_i \\in [-M,M]$ and construct the private mechanism as follow:\n$$Z_i = X_i + \\sigma W_i$$ where $W_i$ is drawn from a Laplace noise (0,1).\nOne can show that :\n$$\\frac{Q(Z = z | x)}{Q(Z = z | x\u0026rsquo;)} \\leq e^{\\frac{1}{\\sigma} * |x - x\u0026rsquo;|} \\leq e^{\\frac{2M}{\\sigma}}$$\nThus, with the choice of $\\sigma = \\frac{2M}{\\alpha}$, it verifies α-local-differentially privacy. The proposed estimator is the following :\n$$\\hat{Z} = \\bar{X} + \\frac{2M}{\\alpha} \\bar{W}$$\nOne can show that it is an unbiaised estimator that achieves the optimal rates:\n$$E[\\hat{Z}] = E[X]$$\n$$V[\\hat{Z}] = \\frac{V(X)}{n} + \\frac{4M^2}{n\\alpha^2} V[\\bar{W}] = \\frac{V(X)}{n} + \\frac{8M^2}{n\\alpha^2}$$ $$E[ |\\hat{Z}- X|^2] \\leq \\frac{C_3}{n\\alpha^2}.$$\nThis is exactly the optimal rates, quite outstanding !\nThe case of density estimation One accurate question that can raise is : what about others distribution ? Is privacy more costly in general cases ? What is the trade-off ?\nTo answer this question, let\u0026rsquo;s precise the problem.\nWe want to estimate in a non-parametric way a 1D-density function f belonging to one of theses classes :\n-Hölder Class (β, L): $\\text{For all }x, y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\text{ and } m \\leq \\beta, \\quad \\left| f^{(m)}(x) - f^{(m)}(y) \\right| \\leq L \\left| x - y \\right|^{\\beta - m}$\n-Sobolev Class: $F_{\\beta}[C] := \\left( f \\in L^2([0, 1]) , \\middle| , f = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\theta_j \\phi_j \\text{ such that } \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} j^{2\\beta} \\phi_j^2 \\leq C^2 \\right)$\nIn a intuitition way, those two classes express that f is smooth enough to admits Lipschitz constant to its derivative so that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;vary\u0026rdquo; locally too much.\nTheorem Without privacy One can show that without privacy, the minimax rate achievable for estimating a Hölder Class function is:\n$$\\text{MSE}(\\hat{f} - f) \\leq C_1 \\cdot n^{-\\frac{2\\beta}{1+2\\beta}}$$ with the estimator\n$$\\hat{f}(x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{h} K\\left(\\frac{x - X_i}{h}\\right) \\text{with } h = C_2 \\cdot n^{-\\frac{1}{2\\beta+1}}$$\nIn the case of d-multidimensionnal density f, the optimal rate is :\n$$\\text{MSE}(\\hat{f} - f) \\leq C_4 \\cdot n^{-\\frac{2\\beta}{d+ 2\\beta}}$$ with the estimator\n$$\\hat{f}(x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{h^d} K^d\\left(\\frac{x-X_i}{h}\\right) \\quad \\text{with} \\quad h = C_5 \\cdot n^{-\\frac{1}{2\\beta + d}}$$\nThis illustrates once again the curse of dimensionnality.\nWith privacy Let assume that f bellongs to one of the two classes with β as smoothness parameter.\nThen, the optimal α-local-differentially private optimal rate is :\n$$\\text{MSE}(\\hat{f} - f) \\leq C_1 \\cdot (n\\alpha^2)^{-\\frac{2\\beta}{2\\beta+2}}.$$\nOne may observe two pessimistic news:\n-The rate is affected by a factor of $\\alpha^2$ as for the multinomial estimation\n-More damageable: the rate is slower in term of n unlike the previous problem which make privacy in this case more costly.\nPractical strategies Eventhough this rate is pessimistic and proves that privacy comes at a cost, it remains to illustrates how can we achieves this best but not great rate. For this end, once again, two strategies are possible.\nRandomized responses Laplace Noise (beyond paper) Randomized responses This is the strategy illustrated in the paper and consists of sampling for each coordinate according the realisation of a Bernouilli variable with the correct probability as function of α. As it is not the most comprehensive and straightforward method, we prefer to dive in depth into the second one; uncovered in the paper.\nLaplace Noise (beyond paper) Let assume that $X_i \\in [0,M]$ almost surely. We note $G_j = [\\frac{j-1}{K},\\quad \\frac{j}{K}]$ the bin of length $\\frac{1}{K}$.\nWe consider the histogramm estimator: $$\\hat{f}(x) = \\frac{K}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1_{X_i \\in G_j} \\cdot 1_{x \\in G_j}.$$\nWe now construct the private mechanism as follow:\n$$Z_i = \\left[1_{X_i \\in G_1} + \\frac{2}{\\alpha} W_1, \\ldots, 1_{X_i \\in G_K} + \\frac{2}{\\alpha} W_K\\right]$$\nIn an intuitive way, we add a Laplace noise realisation for each bin.\nThis guarantees α-local-differentially privacy as : $$\\frac{Q(Z = z | x)}{Q(Z = z | x\u0026rsquo;)} \\leq \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{K} |1_{x \\in G_j} - 1_{x\u0026rsquo; \\in G_j}| \\right) \\leq \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\cdot 2\\right).$$\nThis leads to the α-local-differentially private estimator :\n$$f_{\\text{private_estimate}} = \\hat{f} + \\frac{2K}{n\\alpha} \\sum_{j=1}^{K} W_j$$\nThe biais is the same as the unprivate case as :\n$$E[f_{\\text{private_estimate}}] = E[\\hat{f}] + 0 .$$\nOne may prove that if f bellongs to the β-Hölder Class:\n$$Biais(f_{\\text{private_estimate}}, f) \\leq C_1 * K^{-\\beta}$$\nMeanwhile, $$V[f_{\\text{private_estimate}}] \\leq \\frac{C_2}{n} + \\frac{4K^2}{\\alpha^2} \\frac{V[W]}{n}$$, such that in total :\n$$\\text{MSE}(f_{\\text{private_estimate}} - f) \\leq C_1 K^{-2\\beta} + \\frac{C_2}{n} + \\frac{C_3 K^2}{n\\alpha^2}.$$ Minimizing over K (hyperparameters) leads to : $K = C_4 \\cdot (n\\alpha^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2\\beta+2}}$ and thus to:\n$$\\text{MSE}(f_{\\text{private_estimate}} - f) \\leq C_5 \\cdot (n\\alpha^2)^{-\\frac{2\\beta}{2\\beta + 2}}$$, which is the expected bound.\nExperiment: Illustration of the Minimax privacy rate Overview The aim of this section is to provide illustrations of the theoretical results set out above. Emphasis is placed on convergence results, with empirical confirmation of the latter.\nFor the sake of reproducibility and transparency, the source code can be found in the notebook at this: Github link.\nMethodology Data Preparation: Rather than working with real datasets, we decide to work with simulated data, as this allows us to maintain control over all aspects. More precisely, we give ourselves $n=1000$ samples of the normal distribution $N(100,1)$ on which we add a Laplace noise $L(0,\\alpha).$\nAs for the different alpha values, we iterate through them: $[0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7]$\nPrivacy Metric Calculation: We will look at the use case of estimating the mean of a distribution.\nEvaluation: The results will be compared in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE).\nResults In terms of the observed distribution (private because subject to Laplace noise) relative to the true data, we obtain the following figure:\nAs expected, the greater the desired privacy (low $\\alpha$), the more spread out the distribution of observed data.\nWhen it comes to estimating the true average from private data, we obtain the following figure:\nThis figure illustrates two major points:\n-The first is that whatever the level of privacy, we have an unbiased estimator of the mean. It\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful property, empirically verified !\n-The second is that, unfortunately, the greater the privacy (low alpha), the greater the variance of this estimator.\nWe recall our main theorem demonstrated above Previous theorem :\nTheorem : Given α-local-differentially private $Z_i$, there exists some arbitrary constants $C_1$, $C_2$ such that for all $\\alpha\\in [0,1]$: $$C_1 min(1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n\\alpha^2}}, \\frac{d}{n\\alpha^2}) ≤ E[|θ_{hat} - θ|^2] ≤ C_2 min(1, \\frac{d}{n\\alpha^2})$$\nWe now want to compare the theoretical optimal rate with empirical results. To do this, we distinguish two situations:\n-The first is with fixed alpha, and determines the MSE as a function of the number of samples n. This leads to these empirical results:\nThe dotted line represents the regime of the theoretical bound of the form $n \\rightarrow \\frac{C1}{n}$ . This is the shape of the empirical curves!\n-The second has a fixed n and determines the MSE as a function of alpha. This leads to these empirical results:\nThe dotted line represents the regime of the theoretical bound of the form $\\alpha \\rightarrow \\frac{C1}{\\alpha^2}$ . This is once again the shape of the empirical curves quite surprisingly!\nConclusion From a problem rooted in an ethical dilemma (privacy versus completeness and transparency), we have looked at the cost of guaranteeing one at the expense of the other, to better sketch out desirable situations.\nThis has enabled us to develop theoretical results in terms of minimax rates. There is indeed a trade-off between these criteria, which is even more costly in the case of non-parametric density estimation.\nFinally, we have compared these theoretical limits with empirical results, which confirm the conformity of the statements.\nThe aim of all this work is to disseminate this important yet under-exploited notion: privacy. To this end, we invite the reader to take the following quiz to ensure his or her understanding.\nQuizz To test yourself abour privacy:\nWhat is privacy?\nAvoid asking questions that can raise private information A mechanism that prevents other agent to retrieve personnal information in your answer An ethical-washing trend Which situation is α-local-differentially privacy?\nsup {Q(Z | Xi = x)/Q(Z | Xi = x')} | x, x' ∈ X} \u003e= exp(α) You tell the truth half the time, you lie otherwise. Z_i = X_i + (2M/α) W_i with W_i drawn from a Laplace Noise(0,1) What is the privacy cost in term of optimal rate ?\nMultinomial estimation: A factor α^2/d Density estimation: from n^(-2β/2β+2) (without privacy) to (nα^2)^(-2β/(2β+2)) We loose nothing, that's the surprising finding of the paper Submit Annexes References Warner SL.
